  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/licenses/

    # Since these files are listed as assets, there is no need to list them
    # in the fonts section of the pubspec.yaml. This can be done because
    # the files are consistently named from the Google Fonts API
    # (so be sure not to rename them!).
    # Ref: https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts
    - assets/fonts/montserrat/

    - assets/images/logos/
    - assets/images/backgrounds/
    - assets/images/visual_elements/
    - assets/images/icons/icons8-google-color/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
